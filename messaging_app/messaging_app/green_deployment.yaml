#Set up a blue-green deployment strategy in Kubernetes where you deploy a new version of the messaging_app (green_deployment.yaml)
# and switch traffic to it using an Ingress resource.
# Ensure that the new version is deployed alongside the existing one (blue deployment) and that traffic is gradually shifted to the new version.
